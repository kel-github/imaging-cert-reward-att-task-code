This repository contains the software written for running the behavioural paradigm outlined in the STRIAVISE project proposal. Cues indicate the probability of an upcoming target's location amd the number of points available if the task is correct.   

Dependencies are listed in the notes in the code.  
Run all *.m files from the same folder. Keep all *.m files in the folder from which the files are stored. See the notes within the *.m files for further details.
