              (frequent stimulus, target stimulus, and distractor). The

              Whereas the role of cortical areas of the nondominant hemisphere
              on spatial attention has been investigated in detail, the impact
              of the BG, and more precisely the subthalamic nucleus, on signs
              and symptoms of spatial attention is not well understood. Here we
              used unilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus
              to reversibly, specifically, and intraindividually modify the
              neuronal BG outflow and its consequences on signs and symptoms of
              visuospatial attention in patients suffering from Parkinson
              disease. We tested 13 patients with Parkinson disease and chronic
              deep brain stimulation in three stimulation settings: unilateral
              right and left deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus
              as well as bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic
              nucleus. In all three stimulation settings, the patients viewed a
              set of pictures while an eye-tracker system recorded eye
              movements. During the exploration of the visual stimuli, we
              analyzed the time spent in each visual hemispace, as well as the
              number, duration, amplitude, peak velocity, acceleration peak,
              and speed of saccades. In the unilateral left-sided stimulation
              setting, patients show a shorter ipsilateral exploration time of
              the extrapersonal space, whereas number, duration, and speed of
              saccades did not differ between the different stimulation
              settings. These results demonstrated reduced visuospatial
              attention toward the side contralateral to the right subthalamic
              nucleus that was not being stimulated in a unilateral left-sided
              stimulation. Turning on the right stimulator, the reduced
              visuospatial attention vanished. These results support the
              involvement of the subthalamic nucleus in modulating spatial
              attention. Therefore, the subthalamic nucleus is part of the
              subcortical network that subserves spatial attention.",

              statistical learning, reward, motivation and emotion also affect
              attention. But do these various factors influence spatial
              attention in the same manner, as suggested by the integrated
              framework of attention, or do they target different aspects of
              spatial attention? Here I present evidence that the control of
              attention may be implemented in two ways. Whereas current goals
              typically modulate where in space attention is prioritized,
              search habits affect how one moves attention in space. Using the
              location probability learning paradigm, I show that a search
              habit forms when people frequently find a visual search target in
              one region of space. Attentional cuing by probability learning
              differs from that by current goals. Probability cuing is implicit
              and persists long after the probability cue is no longer valid.
              Whereas explicit goal-driven attention codes space in an
              environment-centered reference frame, probability cuing is
              viewer-centered and is insensitive to secondary working memory
              load and aging. I propose a multi-level framework that separates
              the source of attentional control from its implementation.
              Similar to the integrated framework, the multi-level framework
              considers current goals, perceptual salience, and selection
              history as major sources of attentional control. However, these
              factors are implemented in two ways, controlling where spatial
              attention is allocated and how one shifts attention in space.",

              Della Libera, Chiara",
  abstract = "Visual selective attention is the brain function that modulates
              ongoing processing of retinal input in order for selected
              representations to gain privileged access to perceptual awareness
              and guide behavior. Enhanced analysis of currently relevant or
              otherwise salient information is often accompanied by suppressed
              processing of the less relevant or salient input. Recent findings
              indicate that rewards exert a powerful influence on the
              deployment of visual selective attention. Such influence takes
              different forms depending on the specific protocol adopted in the
              given study. In some cases, the prospect of earning a larger
              reward in relation to a specific stimulus or location biases
              attention accordingly in order to maximize overall gain. This is
              mediated by an effect of reward acting as a type of incentive
              motivation for the strategic control of attention. In contrast,
              reward delivery can directly alter the processing of specific
              stimuli by increasing their attentional priority, and this can be
              measured even when rewards are no longer involved, reflecting a
              form of reward-mediated attentional learning. As a further
              development, recent work demonstrates that rewards can affect
              attentional learning in dissociable ways depending on whether
              rewards are perceived as feedback on performance or instead are
              registered as random-like events occurring during task
              performance. Specifically, it appears that visual selective
              attention is shaped by two distinct reward-related learning
              mechanisms: one requiring active monitoring of performance and
              outcome, and a second one detecting the sheer association between
              objects in the environment (whether attended or ignored) and the
              more-or-less rewarding events that accompany them. Overall this
              emerging literature demonstrates unequivocally that rewards
              ``teach'' visual selective attention so that processing resources
              will be allocated to objects, features and locations which are
              likely to optimize the organism's interaction with the
              surrounding environment and maximize positive outcome.",

              (goal-directed attention) [1, 2], the physical salience of
              stimuli (stimulus-driven attention) [3-5], and selection history
              [6-12]. This third construct, which encompasses reward learning,
              aversive conditioning, and repetitive orienting behavior [12-18],
              is often characterized as a unitary mechanism of control that can
              be contrasted with the other two [12-14]. Here, we present
              evidence that two different learning processes underlie the
              influence of selection history on attention, with dissociable
              consequences for orienting behavior. Human observers performed an
              antisaccade task in which they were paid for shifting their gaze
              in the direction opposite one of two color-defined targets.
              Strikingly, such training resulted in a bias to do the opposite
              of what observers were motivated and paid to do, with associative
              learning facilitating orienting toward reward cues. On the other
              hand, repetitive orienting away from a target produced a bias to
              repeat this behavior even when it conflicted with current goals,
              reflecting instrumental conditioning of the orienting response.
              Our findings challenge the idea that selection history reflects a
              common mechanism of learning-dependent priority and instead
              suggest multiple distinct routes by which learning history shapes
              orienting behavior. We also provide direct evidence for the idea
              that value-based attention is approach oriented, which limits the

              predictions are combined additively to bias visual selection
              (additive hypothesis), whereas neuroeconomic studies posit that
              they may be multiplicatively combined (expected value
              hypothesis). We sought to arbitrate between these two
              alternatives, and to test the possibility that both operations
              are available to visual prioritization mechanisms, but that their
              use is context dependent (mixed operations hypothesis).
              Participants viewed two coloured placeholders that specified the
              potential value of correctly identifying an imminent letter
              target if it appeared in that placeholder. Then, prior to the
              target9s presentation, an endogenous spatial cue was presented
              indicating the target9s more likely location. Spatial cues were
              parametrically manipulated with regard to the information gained

              the deployment of endogenous spatial attention. Instead,

  abstract = "In order to learn efficiently, organisms must learn how to
              distribute their attention to the available cues. Traditionally,
              most experiments on attention learning have involved discrete
              outcomes (e.g. no food vs. one food pellet, or category A vs.
              category B). A basic finding is that cues receive attention in
              proportion to how well they predict such outcomes. However, more
              recent research has shown an apparently independent effect of
              outcome value on attention (Le Pelley, Mitchell, \& Johnson,
              2013\}, in which cues associated with large rewards receive more
              attention than those associated with small rewards. It has been
              suggested that a separate derived attention mechanism - in which
              attention is based directly on association strength - is
              necessary to explain this result (Le Pelley, Mitchell, Beesley,
              George, \& Wills, 2016). As our primary experimental
              contribution, we use modified versions of this design to
              replicate the value effect and show that it can be reversed by
              manipulating the rewards given for incorrect choices. Our
              simulations show that CompAct - a model in which cues compete for
              attention on the basis of their relative predictiveness - can
              account for both of our empirical results. The derived attention
              theory, in contrast, incorrectly predicts that cues associated
              with large rewards will always receive more attention. We
              conclude that we do not need separate mechanisms to account for
              predictiveness effects and value effects on attention.",

              attentional switching. We here investigated the subcortical
              involvement in reward related top-down control of visual
              alpha-band oscillations (8-13 Hz), which have been consistently
              linked to the mechanisms supporting the allocation of visual
              spatial attention. Given that items associated with contextual
              saliency (e.g. monetary reward or loss) attract attention, it is
              not surprising that alpha oscillations are further modulated by
              the saliency properties of the visual items. The executive
              network controlling such reward-dependent modulations of
              oscillatory brain activity has yet to be fully elucidated.
              Although it has been explored in terms of cortico-cortical
              interaction, such network likely relies also on the contribution
              of subcortical regions. To uncover this, we investigated whether
              derived measures of subcortical structural asymmetries could
              predict interhemispheric modulation of alpha power during a
              spatial attention task. We show that volumetric hemispheric
              lateralization of globus pallidus (GP) and thalamus (Th) explains
              individual hemispheric biases in the ability to modulate
              posterior alpha power. Importantly, for the GP, this effect
              became stronger when the value-saliency parings in the task
              increased. Our findings suggest that the Th and GP in humans are
              part of a subcortical executive control network, differently
              involved in modulating posterior alpha activity. Further
              investigation aimed at uncovering the interaction between
              subcortical and neocortical attentional networks would provide

              Using measures of behavior and brain electricity in male and

              our previous experience of rewards obtained by attending to that

  abstract = "This article presents a comprehensive survey of research
              concerning interactions between associative learning and
              attention in humans. Four main findings are described. First,
              attention is biased toward stimuli that predict their
              consequences reliably (learned predictiveness). This finding is
              consistent with the approach taken by Mackintosh (1975) in his
              attentional model of associative learning in nonhuman animals.
              Second, the strength of this attentional bias is modulated by the
              value of the outcome (learned value). That is, predictors of
              high-value outcomes receive especially high levels of attention.
              Third, the related but opposing idea that uncertainty may result
              in increased attention to stimuli (Pearce \& Hall, 1980),
              receives less support. This suggests that hybrid models of
              associative learning, incorporating the mechanisms of both the
              Mackintosh and Pearce-Hall theories, may not be required to
              explain data from human participants. Rather, a simpler model, in
              which attention to stimuli is determined by how strongly they are
              associated with significant outcomes, goes a long way to account
              for the data on human attentional learning. The last main
              finding, and an exciting area for future research and theorizing,
              is that learned predictiveness and learned value modulate both
              deliberate attentional focus, and more automatic attentional
              capture. The automatic influence of learning on attention does
              not appear to fit the traditional view of attention as being
              either goal-directed or stimulus-driven. Rather, it suggests a
              new kind of ``derived'' attention.",

              concerning the role of a highly interconnected network of brain
              areas including orbital and medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala,
              striatum and dopaminergic mid-brain in reward processing.
              Distinct reward-related functions can be attributed to different
              components of this network. Orbitofrontal cortex is involved in
              coding stimulus reward value and in concert with the amygdala and
              ventral striatum is implicated in representing predicted future
              reward. Such representations can be used to guide action
              selection for reward, a process that depends, at least in part,
              on orbital and medial prefrontal cortex as well as dorsal
              striatum.",

              determinants of goal-directed and habitual action",
  author   = "Balleine, Bernard W and O'Doherty, John P",
  abstract = "Recent behavioral studies in both humans and rodents have found
              evidence that performance in decision-making tasks depends on two
              different learning processes; one encoding the relationship
              between actions and their consequences and a second involving the
              formation of stimulus-response associations. These learning
              processes are thought to govern goal-directed and habitual
              actions, respectively, and have been found to depend on
              homologous corticostriatal networks in these species. Thus,
              recent research using comparable behavioral tasks in both humans
              and rats has implicated homologous regions of cortex (medial
              prefrontal cortex/medial orbital cortex in humans and prelimbic
              cortex in rats) and of dorsal striatum (anterior caudate in
              humans and dorsomedial striatum in rats) in goal-directed action
              and in the control of habitual actions (posterior lateral putamen
              in humans and dorsolateral striatum in rats). These learning
              processes have been argued to be antagonistic or competing
              because their control over performance appears to be all or none.
              Nevertheless, evidence has started to accumulate suggesting that
              they may at times compete and at others cooperate in the
              selection and subsequent evaluation of actions necessary for
              normal choice performance. It appears likely that cooperation or
              competition between these sources of action control depends not
              only on local interactions in dorsal striatum but also on the
              cortico-basal ganglia network within which the striatum is
              embedded and that mediates the integration of learning with basic
              motivational and emotional processes. The neural basis of the
              integration of learning and motivation in choice and
              decision-making is still controversial and we review some recent
              hypotheses relating to this issue.",

  abstract = "Stimuli associated with high rewards evoke stronger neuronal
              activity than stimuli associated with lower rewards in many brain
              regions. It is not well understood how these reward effects
              influence activity in sensory cortices that represent low-level
              stimulus features. Here, we investigated the effects of reward
              information in the primary visual cortex (area V1) of monkeys. We
              found that the reward value of a stimulus relative to the value
              of other stimuli is a good predictor of V1 activity. Relative
              value biases the competition between stimuli, just as has been
              shown for selective attention. The neuronal latency of this
              reward value effect in V1 was similar to the latency of
              attentional influences. Moreover, V1 neurons with a strong value
              effect also exhibited a strong attention effect, which implies
              that relative value and top-down attention engage overlapping, if
              not identical, neuronal selection mechanisms. Our findings
              demonstrate that the effects of reward value reach down to the
              earliest sensory processing levels of the cerebral cortex and
              imply that theories about the effects of reward coding and
              top-down attention on visual representations should be unified.",
